# hire-me

Interested in me being on your team? Fork this repository, create a blank file in the applications directory with the company name and job title, and fill in the pull request.

I have already had multiple other opportunities presented to me, such as from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> Foundation (with maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper">Yellow Paper</a>), <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tenzorum.org/" target="_blank">Tenzorum</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aragon.one/" target="_blank">Aragon</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://status.im/" target="_blank">Status</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.synthetix.io/" target="_blank">Synthetix</a>. Other innovative projects and ideas include those listed <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Decentralized-apps-(dapps)">here</a>. I'll be following up on those opportunities.</p>

<p>I've applied with Parity Technologies, but positions for Rust/Core developer are not available until April.</p>
